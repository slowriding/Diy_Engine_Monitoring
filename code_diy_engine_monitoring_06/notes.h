/* 
  * This prototype has evolved is partialy working in a 2002 Tahoe
  * Mostly it is working, The sensors require calibration
  * The drivers for the dashboard gauges have yet to be worked out
  * CAN and GM LAN bus connections are not implemented yet
  * Frequency inputs are ot yet impelmented 
  * Stubs exist for some unfinished code.

  * Please consider subbmitting improvements and/or rewrites

  * 1-wire DS18xxx not working - wiring isssue

  * Add Screen dimming
  * add counter if current value != last value to run anyway from time to time (refresh, timetarget?)
  * LCD inputs page add i_currents and rpm & VSS raw
  * add colors to all feilds
  * Add PWM bar graph gauge data to Detailed page
  * Mil display should be scrolling text box of faults and have color indications of severity
